This repo contains example code for running Bayesian model selection with the Prince William Sound herring Bayesian age-structured stock assessment model (BASA). The manuscript for this analysis is in revision at ICES.

bin contains AD Model Builder (ADMB) files for different versions of BASA. src contains R code to fit model sets that differ by the way ecological covariates are handled. Namely, covariates are incorporated into different processes (natural mortality or recruitment), different years, or under different statistical assumptions (i.e. informing annual errors as fixed effects or as 'data' being fit).

All files (code and results) are too numerous to save so are excluded. For questions on specific models or code, please contact j.t.trochta@gmail.com.
